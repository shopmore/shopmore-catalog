# ShopMore is ServerLess

ShopMore the catalog.


## Development

Supported environment: Mac OSX Big Sur, Linux Ubuntu 20, Windows 10 with WSL 2

Other environments may work, but YMMV (aka, it is up to you...).

The first time, run `bash setup.sh`

Every time you start to work, initialize the environment with `source init.src`

Occasionally, when the init script will tell you, run `bash setup.sh` again.
